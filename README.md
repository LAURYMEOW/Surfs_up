## Overview of the statistical analysis:
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop.
Specifically, he ask me temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

The analysis was done for the two months as Avy suggested, having the following results:

* For the month of June, on average from 2010 to 2017 there was a maximum temperature of 85°, a minimum of 64° and an average of 74°.
The standard deviation is 3.26 that indicates that the data is not very dispersed from the mean, so 74° is a good reference for that month.
Acceptable temperature to continue with the typical activities of the area.

* For the month of December, it was obtained that on average from 2010 to 2017 there was a maximum temperature of 83°, a minimum of 56° and an average of 71°.
Although the maximum temperature does not differ much from that of June, the minimum and average temperatures are 8 and 3 degrees lower, respectively.
The standard deviation is 3.74 that indicates that the data is not very dispersed from the mean, so 71° is a good reference for that month.
These results suggest that December is usually a month with lower temperatures and it is very probably that the activities of the place will be reduced, but they do not imply a total cancellation.

To complement the above information, I decided to review the precipitation statistics, which allows me to make an approximate analysis to the possible impact of thermal sensation due to humidity, having the following results:

* For the month of June, on average from 2010 to 2017, a maximum precipitation of 4.43, a minimum of 0 and an average of 0.13 was recorded.
which indicates that it is not a month that rains a lot and if it does, it does with very low levels, so it is very likely that the thermal sensation does not vary much with respect to the real temperature.

* For the month of December, on average from 2010 to 2017, there was a maximum precipitation of 6.42, a minimum of 0 and an average of 0.21.
With this information we can have a possible hypothesis that the month of December may feel a little colder than the actual temperature indicates.

##Summary:

The analysis of trends gave me very useful information to have a broader notion of what can be expected for the months analyzed.
It is very likely that the activity level of our business will descend due to the weather in the month of December.

To make the results more robust, I decided to evaluate the temperatures and rainfall per month. In this way I could see more clearly the behavior of the weather on Oahu.
With this analysis I discovered that there are a couple of months that are even colder both in terms of temperature and precipitation than December, these are January and March.
Which allows us to consider winter as a low season but with activity in the demand for our service. However, months were found with perfect climates (above 72 degrees on average) for our business,
This is the period that covers the months of May to November. This season can very well compensate for the low season of winter.
